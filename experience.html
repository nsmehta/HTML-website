            <li>Conceptualized and developed a healthcare-financial project as a full-stack web-applications developer.</li>
            <li>Part of a team which managed the entire project module, including web development, unit testing, deployment and management of servers (AWS EC2 Ubuntu). The code versioning was maintained using Git. Enabled cross-system utilization of the web-application by developing Android and iOS apps for the project. We followed agile methodology during development and testing phases.</li>
            <li><b>Technology Stack:</b> AngularJS in the front-end, PHP-MongoDB in the middleware, and Java-MySQL in the back-end. REST APIs for communication between the front-end and middleware, and middleware and back-end.</li>
            <li><b>Accomplishment:</b> Received two ‘Pat on the Back’ awards for outstanding contributions in the project.</li>
            <li><b>Online Marketplace Analysis:</b> Worked on another project on online marketplace analysis. Procured shipping, sales and geographical data from sample marketplaces built on Magento and Shopify, and performed analytics over the data to recommend products to be sold at which locations, which locations are experiencing low sales, etc. Web Hooks were used to periodically read data from the marketplaces and RabbitMQ was used to queue the incoming data for a large data set.</li>

<!--
          Worked as a Software Developer. My work primarily involved building web-applications in PHP. I worked on technologies
          such as AngularJS, jQuery, Java, MongoDB, MySQL, RabbitMQ, Jenkins, Cordova, HTML5, CSS, etc. I was also responsible for
          weekly calls with the client, requirement understanding, converting requirements into tasks and diving the task within the
          team. We used GitHub for version control and BitBucket for issue tracking. I also mentored a new graduate who joined GS Lab
          and helped bring an internal project to completion.<br/>
          I was well appreciated by the client for my work and I was given a Pat-on-the-Back Award (Monthly Award for excellence in the
          work done for a project), twice by my Manager.
