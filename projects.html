          <h3 class="panel-title">Time and Space Efficient Construction of CCDBG</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          Working on an Advanced Project involving reducing the space and time complexity of Colored Compacted De Bruijn Graph. The projecct is being done under the guidance of Prof. Rob Patro. We are using the tool TwoPaCo. The output of this tool is given to Pufferfish and we are researching ways to reduce the time and space constraints to make the step more efficient for large scale genomes.<br/>
          Used: C++
        </div>
        <div class="panel-heading">
          <h3 class="panel-title">SBUnix</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          Developed an Operating System on top of a Bootloader. The project involved writing own kernel modules, paging mechanism, creating and executing user processes by ring switch, process scheduling and read-only file system.<br/>
          Used: C, Assembly Language
        </div>
        <div class="panel-heading">
          <h3 class="panel-title">The Searching Pacman</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          Implemented searching algorithms like Breadth-First Search, Depth-Firsst Search, A Star Algorithm,
          Backtracking, Constraint Satisfaction Problem, etc in a team of 2 members, to direct the Pacman to find its goal. Its a famous
          search problem proposed by University of Berkeley as an introductory project for Artificial Intelligence course.
          Did this project as part of CSE537.<br/>
          Used: Python

        <div class="panel-heading">
          <h3 class="panel-title">Spam Filter</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          Implemented Naive Bayes Classification Algorithm to label emails as spam or not spam, using Python. Used Laplacian smoothing to avoid zero probabilities for the data. Achieved an accuracy of 90%.<br/>
          Used: Python

          <h3 class="panel-title">Phenotypic Prediction from Transcriptomic Features</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          Completed a prediction model that can approximate the original label from the human population and sequence center data given as output by Salmon (http://salmon.readthedocs.io). We achieved an accuracy of 71% using Extras Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifiers from the SkLearn package of Python. We also used the labelâ€™s equivalence classes to improve the accuracy.<br/>
          Used: Python
        </div>

          <h3 class="panel-title">Healthcare Financial Website</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          Worked in a team of 4-5 members to develop an interactive website which helps people find the best healthcare plan as per
          their demographics and personal information. The project involved scrum calls with the client, agile methodology for the tasks,
          rigorous testing and weekly deployment. The front-end communicated with the middleware using REST API calls and the data was fetched
          by the middleware from the back-end and provided to the fron-end for display purposes. We also developed iOS and Android apps for
          the same Web-application.<br/>
          Used: PHP, AngularJS, jQuery, Java, MongoDB, MySQL, Cordova

        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          Worked on creating an online marketplace analytics website, in a team of 3. We procured shipping, sales and geographical data from sample marketplaces built on Magento and Shopify, and performed analytics over the data to recommend which products should be sold at which locations, which locations are experiencing low sales, which products are selling well in the market, etc. Web Hooks were used to periodically read data from the marketplaces and RabbitMQ was used to queue the incoming data for a large data set.<br/>
          Used: PHP, Python, AngularJS, MySQL, RabbitMQ, Highcharts, Cron-jobs
